# FPS-BOOM
General, Client-only FPS performance.  Not modpack or server specific.

This pack works for single player, regular spigot/paper based servers, and can be used with Fabric servers.

Additional non-FPS boots are expected if the server has various compatible elements like sodium etc.

This is a PACK - all included mods have their own license, all included mods reside on Modrinth. This pack was primarily assembled for a private server.

Is available to download from: https://modrinth.com/modpack/fps-boom    Or in your launcher if it has Modrinth Modpacks. 


Pack is built using Packwiz: https://packwiz.infra.link/
